### Hello World ðŸ‘‹{_he he he_:grinning:}
The name's Joshua. I'm a budding Software Engineer from Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬. I have a strong interest in Javascript and all it can accomplish when employed by a curious mind. I have a strong passion for React Native and the Open-Source (and larger developer) community.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

-Remote internship.

-Independent work building with React Native

-Technical writing and journaling.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... a lot of things. Find out more from the forked repo ("Learning Tracker").
I'm also looking for opportunities to collaborate with seasoned devs. I would appreciate reaching out ðŸ“« through the following:
