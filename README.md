...Joshua. I'm a Software Developer from Nigeria 🇳🇬. I have a strong interest in Javascript<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png/240px-JavaScript-logo.png" width="20px">  and all it can accomplish when employed by a curious mind. I have a similarly strong passion for React Native and the Open-Source (and the larger developer) community.

🔭 I’m currently working on:

👨‍💻 Independent work and projects building with React Native. A number of them can be found on this profile. 
They are all constantly being re-jigged and refactored.

-Technical writing and journaling at [hashnode](https://firstchaircoder.hashnode.dev/)

🌱 I’m currently learning ... a lot of things.
I'm also looking for opportunities to collaborate with seasoned devs. I would appreciate reaching out 📫 through the following:

🥂 Cheers..

:punch:Carpe Diem!.
