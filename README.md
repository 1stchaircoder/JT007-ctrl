### Hello World ðŸ‘‹{_he he he_:grinning:}
The name's Joshua. I'm a Software Engineer from Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬. I have a strong interest in Javascript and all it can accomplish when employed by a curious mind. I have a similarly strong passion for React Native and the Open-Source (and the larger developer) community.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

-Remote tasks and freelancing.(and actively seeking job opportunities).

-Independent work and projects building with React Native

-Technical writing and journaling at [hashnode](https://firstchaircoder.hashnode.dev/)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... a lot of things.
I'm also looking for opportunities to collaborate with seasoned devs. I would appreciate reaching out ðŸ“« through the following:
